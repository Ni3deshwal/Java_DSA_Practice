# ðŸŒ± Features of Spring Framework

## 1. Inversion of Control (IoC)

The **IoC container** manages the lifecycle and configuration of application objects, also called **beans**.  
This makes it easier to manage dependencies and object creation.

---

## 2. Dependency Injection (DI)

**Dependency Injection** is a way of injecting dependencies into objects, rather than creating or managing them manually.  
It is achieved using the **Spring IoC container**, which is responsible for creating and managing objects known as **beans**.

### ðŸ“‚ Types of Dependency Injection in Spring

#### âœ… Constructor Injection  
Spring injects dependencies through the class constructor.

#### âœ… Setter Injection  
Spring injects dependencies via public setter methods.

#### âœ… Field Injection *(less preferred)*  
Dependencies are injected directly into fields using annotations.

## 3. Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP)
Withou way of cross cutting concern, you have insert the same logging, security or transaction code into many different places into you application.This can make your code messy and harder to maintain.AOP help by allowing you to handle these concern in centralized way,applying them accross your application where needed without mixing them into core logic.
