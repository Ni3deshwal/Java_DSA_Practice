Feature of Spring Frame work
1. Inversion of control(IOC):-
                               The IOC container manage the lifecycle and configuration of application and objects(beans), make easier way to manage dependencies and object creation.
2. Dependecy Injection(DI):-
                               DI is a way of inject the dependencies rather then having to create or manage them explicitly. It is achieved spring IOC container which is responsible for manage and create objects
                               known as beans.
